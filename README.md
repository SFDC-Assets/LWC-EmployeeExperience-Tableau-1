## Setup
Before you deploy this repository of code, take note of the following:

### LWC Setup Note #1

As we need to reference Tableau’s Javascript API, we need to upload the Javascript zip file as a Static Resource in Salesforce. 

Here’s where you get it:

- Check out [get started here](https://tinyurl.com/y79apbke) on what are the functions Tableau JS API can do
- Use this [public hosted Javascript file](https://tinyurl.com/ycdo8l99) to get zip file for static resource

### LWC Setup Note #2

In the Git Repository, refer to  supplierDashboard component for creating a record in Salesforce by clicking on Tableau dashboard.

1. Import Tableau JS file
2. renderedCallback() and initViz() 
  →  define which Tableau dashboard to render

    Dashboard URL here is from a Tableau Online instance, remember to replace it with ones from [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/fshih#!/vizhome/EmployeeExperience/eeInsights)

3. listenToMarkSelection() 
  → listens to user interaction with Tableau
4. onMarkSelection()
  → triggers actions, in this case create a Case record in Salesforce
